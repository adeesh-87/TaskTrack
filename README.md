# 🧠 TaskTrack: Your Notes-First Productivity Assistant

TaskTrack is a minimalist, markdown-powered task and note-taking assistant, built with FastAPI on the backend and React on the frontend. It's designed to be local-first, privacy-focused, and extendable with LLM-powered features.

This branch — **`selfhost`** — is intended for users who want to run TaskTrack fully on their own machine or private server, with **no external dependencies**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Write markdown-formatted notes, one per task
- ✅ Create, view, and edit tasks
- 🔄 Instant syncing between frontend and backend
- 🌐 Self-contained app — backend serves both API and frontend
- ☁️ Built with FastAPI + React + TailwindCSS

> 📌 _LLM-based features (like auto-tagging, summarization, and task suggestion) are coming soon._
